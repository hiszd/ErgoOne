# Keyboard Firmware for the Noiz ErgoOne

This firmware was created for the Noiz ErgoOne keyboard.
This keyboard was designed to combine the split Ergodox style keyboard into one PCB.

This firmware was programmed in Rust so to build:
``` sh
cargo build --release
```

And to run and use a debugger:
``` sh
cargo run --release
```
